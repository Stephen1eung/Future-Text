# Future-Text
An application that allows users to specify specific dates to receive and send messages could be called a "Scheduled Messaging App". This app would enable users to schedule messages for a later time and date, allowing them to plan and organize their communication with others more efficiently.

The app would typically include features such as a messaging interface where users can compose and send messages, as well as a scheduling interface where users can choose the exact date and time for their messages to be sent or received. Users may also be able to set recurring schedules for messages to be sent at regular intervals.

Additionally, the app may include notifications to remind users of scheduled messages that are coming up or have been sent, as well as options to edit or cancel scheduled messages if necessary.
